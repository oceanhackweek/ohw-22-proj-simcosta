### Background
SiMCosta is a Brazilian Coast Monitoring System created to collect oceanographical and meterological data, supporting brazilian research since 2014. The project has floating and fixed platforms along the coast of Brazil that are equiped with instruments and sensors to measure parameters as: wind direction and speed, water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll *a* and others.   

**Name of the Buoy:** SC-1

**Location:** 27°16'28" S / 48°25'16" W

### Goals
- Create time series
- Make correlations between physical and biological parameters
- Identify and comprehend oceanographycal events at the south coast of Brazil

### Datasets
- SiMCosta Datasets from Buoy SC-1: https://simcosta.furg.br/home

### Workflow
- Day One: We created the group and defined the project
- Day Two: We created the environment and explored the data
- Day Three: We cleaned the data and created a time series. We specified the period and parameters that we are going to analyse.
- Day Four:
